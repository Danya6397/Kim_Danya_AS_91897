               You may find that with oily skin less is more. Too many products can clog your pores instead of relieving them. With this skin type it is doubly important to make sure you are cleansing properly and thoroughly. Although moisturiser may seem counter productive it is good for even oily skin to make sure it is staying hydrated. Try to look for a light weight moisturiser without oils. If you are concerned with the overall sheen of your face (especially in summer) look for blotting paper. These will clear some of the oil off your face.

            <h3>Get to know your skin</h3>
            <p>Oily skin is where your skin produces too much sebum. While this is a natural oil that helps keep your skin hydrated, too much can lead to clogged pores. It is common for this skin type to be caused by genetics or hormones. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Oily skin generally appears to be: 
            <br>
            Shiny
            <br>
            Visible pores
            <br>
            Thicker or 'dense'
            </p>

            <h4>Ingredients to look out for</h4>
            <p>Salicylic acid- This ingredient has the ability to thoroughly cleanse pores to remove excess oil and dead skin cells. It is also called BHA
            <br> 
            Niacinamide- Niacinamide can reduce sebum production while minimising pores to help the overall complexion of the skin. 
            <br>
            Zinc PCA- Similarly to niacinimide, Zinc PCA regulates oil production. It also has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties to help irritation on the skin’s surface.
            <br>
            Clay- Most useful in the form of masks, this ingredient draws excess oil from the skin as it dries. This can help control the overall shininess of the skin.
            <br>
            Try to find non-pore clogging products. This is generally classified as non-comeogenic but it is best to check and make sure there are no ingredients such as cocoa butter. Avoid fragrances and alcohol based products.
