                <p>Skin care is a form of self care. Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ? It is often neglected even though it does such amazing things like protecting you against bacteria, regulating temperature and healing miraculously quickly. Your skin is your immune system’s first line of defense and it is important to take care of it as such. Not only is caring for your skin beneficial for you physically, but it can also be quite helpful to you mentally. As teenagers I’m sure we have all felt how crazy busy our lives can get. Amidst all the chaos of studying, sports and maybe even working, it’s hard to find time to relax for even a little moment. By integrating moments of skincare into your life and making the practice of it a habit, you will have moments of your day to just pause for a moment and focus on yourself. Even if that moment is only the minute it takes to cleanse your face and apply some moisturiser, it will help you start the day on a good note, knowing that you have done something good for yourself. So you see, skincare is actually the most accessible and most common form of self care. The only problem is that people don’t consider it to be so. To truly appreciate the power of skin care you need to understand what your skin does for you and hence why this website was created! Here you will hopefully learn more about your skin and how to care for it correctly.  </p>

                <h2>Acne</h2>
                <h5>Acne is Normal!</h5>
                <p>According to <a href="https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/acne">healthify.nz</a>, “Acne affects about 85% of people 12 to 24 years old.” Although it affects some more severely than others, it is simply a normal part of growing up and being a teenager. Nowadays, the media likes to make a big deal out of clean, glassy skin but realistically this is almost impossible to achieve, not to mention unnecessary. When people look at you, they will not judge you because you have acne. They will not count the pimples on your face and decide they don’t want to be friends with you. They will look at you and try to find a smile, a good sense of humour, a common interest. Your exterior does not matter in the long haul. We will all get old and wrinkly eventually. What matters is that you can accept your acne and often, acceptance requires understanding.</p>
                <h5>Causes for Acne</h5>
                <p>First it is important to note that acne can be caused by a variety of factors. The most common being your hormones, genetics and hygiene. All three of these factors can cause your pores to become clogged with excess sebum or dirt which will lead to acne if not taken care of properly. <br><strong>Acne has also been linked to other factors such as:
                <br>-menstruation 
                <br>-medications
                <br>-cosmetic products
                <br>-diet</strong>
                <br>Although these factors are indeed different they lead back to the same 3 reasons for which your pores can get clogged. Menstruation can cause your hormones to fluctuate and release more sebum. Same with medicine.  Cosmetic products can directly affect your pores and skin barrier while your diet will have an effect on bodily functions such as cleansing your gut (and in turn your hormones).
                </p>
                <h5>Treatments</h5>
                <p>The most common way to treat acne is to properly take care of your skin. There is a wide range of <strong>skin care products</strong> available to treat various problems including acne. However, just like how everyone has a different personality and appearance, our skin can be unique as well. Everyone’s skin can function in a different way and understanding the signs of what it is asking for can help you take care of it. A good place to start is with this <a href="test.html">skin type test</a>. After finding your skin type you can check out the individual skin types for more in depth advice about what products to look for. Acne is generally more common in oily skin types rather than dry skin types due to the nature of sebum production being the cause of pore clogging, however acne can be present at varying degrees regardless of this. A type of product that may benefit anyone is spot treatment. Usually found in the form of creams it can be directly applied to resistant pimples in order to help clear them. <strong>Over-the-counter medication</strong> is also available as a form of acne treatment. This has varying results with a few side-effects such as increased sun sensitivity, fluctuating moods and gastrointestinal issues. Please speak to your GP if you wish to consider this option.

            <div class="spf" class="para" id="spf">
                <h2>SPF and Sun Safety</h2>
                <p>One of the most fundamental parts of skin care is sun care! For us Kiwi’s we’re actually exposed to more UV rays than other countries due to the fast deteriorating ozone layer. No matter what age you are, what skin type you have, or what season it is, it is vital to slip slap slop. <strong><a href="https://www.aucklandskin.co.nz/">Auckland Skin and Dermatology Specialists</a> state that, “As well as sunburn, too much UV can damage your skin, cause premature aging and lead to skin cancer.”</strong> Sun block should always be the last step of your skin care routine before you leave your house in the morning. Not only that but it should be reapplied generously throughout the day. Most sun blocks will actually say how often the product should be applied on the label. Some people don’t like the ‘greasy’ feeling that sun block often has, especially if they already have somewhat oily skin. For these people I would recommend finding a light, oil free sun block. The label <strong>‘non-comeogenic’</strong> means that it generally will not clog your pores. Some sun blocks are made specifically to be applied only on the face. These are generally more lightweight but also means that they require more frequent application. If the stark white cast of the sun block is making you look overly pale then you can actually find tinted sun blocks called ‘BB cream’ which can blend in like a layer of foundation. No matter what kind of sun block you go for, <strong>it is always essential that you check the SPF</strong>. This stands for Sun Protection Factor, and it measures just how resistant the sunblock can be to UV rays. It can range from spf 15 to spf 50 (I suggest you go for spf 50).   </p>

                <h2>Skincare Ingredients + Key Terms</h2>
                
                <p>When you walk into a chemist it is easy to be overwhelmed by the almost infinite amount of products lining the shelves. They all state that they will ‘hydrate’ and give your skin that ‘radiant glow’ but will they really? It’s important to understand that the primary goal of these skincare companies is to sell their products and that means advertising them in as much glamour as legally possible. Although the packaging might not be outright lying, it’s still essential to check the actual ingredients of a product first. </p>
                <h5>How to read skincare ingredients</h5>
                <p><strong>The list of ingredients can be found on the side or back of the product packaging</strong>. They are listed in descending order from the most prominent to the least concentrated. Most of the words will probably look like gibberish at first but it should be easy enough to scan through it all if you know what you’re looking for. Lucky for you, this website has all the information you need to go find the ingredients that work best for you. Simply take this <a href="test.html">skin-type test</a> or go straight to advice pages tailored to your skin type. There you can find a list of ingredients to look for and even a few to avoid. 
                </p>
                <h5>Key Terms:</h5>
                <p><strong>Pores-</strong> a minute opening on your skin that may allow liquids and gases to pass through the surface of your skin
                <br><strong>Sebum-</strong> A naturally produced, oil like substance that helps keep the surface of your skin hydrated.
                <br><strong>Skin-type-</strong> the nature of your skin or the way it behaves
                <br><strong>T-zone-</strong> Your forehead, nose and chin. These are also the places most prone to acne
                <br><strong>Patch testing-</strong> trying out a product on a small area of skin before using it on your face to avoid a more severe allergic reaction.
                <br><strong>Exfoliant-</strong> Present in both physical and chemical forms, it is a form of product which can remove dead skin cells and help refresh the surface of your skin. This is not a treatment recommended for daily use as it can also stip the skin of its protective layer if used in excess.

            <div class="holistic" class="para" id="holistic">
                <h2>Holistic Skincare</h2>
                <p>Sometimes people find that all the products and numerous chemical ingredients applied on the skin have little to no effect. Of course, skin care does not just mean applying products. In fact these holistic methods of skin care are just as important if not more so for your overall skin health. Here are some holistic methods of skin care you should try out:

                </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                    <br>
                    <mark>Nutrition and gut health</mark>
                    <br>
                    Your skin can reflect what’s going on inside your body. By eating well and fueling yourself your hormone levels will be regulated. Nutrition also ties into the ‘gut-skin axis’ which is the relationship of the gut bacteria and your skin. A healthy gut microbiome helps maintain a healthy skin barrier. Focus on eating whole foods (things that haven’t been made in a factory) with high fibre. Fruits, vegetables and nuts are rich in antioxidants, vitamins and healthy fats that help reduce inflammation and acne. For example, <strong>avocado, walnuts, kale, broccoli and blueberries</strong> are all immensely beneficial for you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <mark>Regular exercise</mark>
                    <br>
                    Exercise gets your heart pumping and in turn your blood circulation running. This can help cleanse your body of toxins and sweating may even clear your pores further. Just remember to cleanse your face afterwards. Exercise doesn’t have to mean going on long runs. In fact <strong>even a walk or a bit of pilates</strong> that makes you break a sweat can be beneficial. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <mark>Managing stress</mark>
                    <br>
                    Stress hormones can negatively affect your skin by increasing cortisol which causes sensitivity and inflammation. To manage this, try to practice a bit of mindfulness from time to time. <strong>Write in a journal, meditate or just reconnect with nature for a while</strong>. All of these activities can help you disconnect from the rush of daily life and distance you from any stressors. If these calming activities aren’t for you, you can find an interesting hobby such as <strong>baking or gardening</strong> that will distract you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <mark>Sleep</mark> 
                    <br>
                    Sleep is crucial to the healthy state of your skin. Without it your skin isn’t given an opportunity to repair itself. Your hormone and cortisol levels can also spike without stress, while your mind is left cloudy and disorientated. Make sure you get at least <strong>7-8 hours of quality sleep</strong> every night to ensure that your skin cells have a chance to repair themselves. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <mark>Environment & general hygiene</mark>
                    <br>
                    Your skin may be reactive to pollutants in the environment such as smoke and pollen. Limit exposure to toxins and if its possible try to invest in an air purifier. You may also be unknowingly causing more acne with simple habits such as picking at your skin or allowing your shampoo to run down your face. Some changes you can make to your environment include <strong>changing your pillowcase regularly, wiping your phone case, and avoiding touching your face.</strong>
